# Task3
In this section, I have written various SQL SELECT queries to retrieve data from the student table. First, I used the SELECT * statement to fetch all the columns and rows.
Then, I demonstrated how to retrieve specific columns like s_name and marks. 
I used the WHERE clause to filter records based on conditions such as department being 'IT'. 
To refine the filtering, I included examples of AND and OR conditions. 
The LIKE query was used to find names starting with the letter 'R', and the BETWEEN clause was used to select students with marks in a specific range.
I also used the ORDER BY clause to sort records in descending order of marks and alphabetically by department and name. 
Lastly, the LIMIT clause was used to display only the top 3 rows based on marks.
